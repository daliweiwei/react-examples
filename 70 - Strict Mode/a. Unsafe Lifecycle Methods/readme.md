# Strict Mode

The Strict Mode element doesn't render any UI. Instead it adds a number of checks with warnings for its descendants.

## Unsafe lifecycle methods

Detecting use of unsafe lifecycle methods in your own code is relatively straightforward. When using 3rd party components it might be harder though. Wrap that code in `<StrictMode>` to detect usage.

Unsafe lifecycle methods are:

- componentWillMount
- componentWillReceiveProps
- componentWillUpdate

Here is an example of how the warnings might look like:
